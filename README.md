# realityserver-client

A lightweight, modern JavaScript client library to connect to and render using
[migenius's](https://migenius.com "migenius")
[RealityServer](https://www.migenius.com/products/realityserver "RealityServer")Â®. Natively supports
modern evergreen browsers and Node.js.

## Introduction

The legacy JavaScript client library shipped with RealityServer was designed in 2010, back when
JavaScript in the browser was mostly unusable without some sort of framework like jQuery, WebSockets
were still under design and JavaScript on the server was virtually unheard of (RealityServer being
one of the exceptions). A lot has changed since then, JavaScript has significantly evolved and is
supported by a huge module ecosystem, WebSockets are under the hood of everything and Node.js is
becoming ubiquitous.

The RealityServer client library however has barely changed. Until now.

`realityserver-client` is a Promise based, ES6 RealityServer client library that can be used
directly both in the browser and Node.js. It utilises WebSockets for all communications providing
fast and efficient command execution. The WebSocket connection can stream images to the client
directly from render loops and provides synchronized command execution, ensuring that no changes are
lost and letting you know exactly when changes appear in rendered images.

`realityserver-client` requires at least RealityServer 5.2 2272.266.

## Usage

Download the [minified](https://unpkg.com/@migenius/realityserver-client@1.0.0 "RealityServer client library")
library and include it directly in your HTML, or install via `npm install
@migenius/realityserver-client` and use as a module in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org "Node.js")
directly or via your favorite bundler (EG: [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org "rollup.js")
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/ "Webpack")
[Broswerify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify "Browerify")). Then simply instantiate
`RS.Service`, connect to your RealityServer and start sending commands.

#### Browser

```html
<script source='/js/realityserver.js'></script>
```
```javascript
const service = new RS.Service();

service.connect('ws://host.example.com/service/')
  .then(() => {
    return service.queue_commands()
      .queue(new RS.Command('create_scope',{scope_name:'myscope'}))
      .queue(new RS.Command('use_scope',{scope_name:'myscope'}))
      .queue(new RS.Command('import_scene',
        {
          scene_name:'myscene',
          block:true,
          filename: 'scenes/meyemII.mi'
        }),true) // the response from this will resolve next
      .execute();
  })
  .then(([scene_info]) => {
    if (scene_info instanceof RS.Error) {
      console.log(`Scene load error: ${scene_info.toString())}`);
    } else {
      // scene is loaded, do some more work with it
      scene_loaded(scene_info);
    }
  })
  .catch(err => {
      // service promises only reject for system errors, not command errors so
      // this is likely a connection problem.
      console.error(`Failed to connect to RealityServer: ${err.toString()}`);
  });
```
#### Node
```javascript
// Node has no native socket implementation so we use the 'websocket' module from npm
const WS = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket; // ensure we have the W3C compliant API
const { Service, Command, Error: Rs_error, Utils } = require('@migenius/realityserver-client');

async () => {
  const service = new Service();
  // pass in a websocket implementation to use rather than a URL.
  try {
    await service.connect(new WS('ws://host.example.com/service/'));
  } catch(err) {
    console.error(`Failed to connect to RealityServer: ${err.toString()}`);
    return; 
  }
  try {
    const [ scene_info ] = await service.queue_commands()
      .queue(new Command('create_scope',{scope_name:'myscope'}))
      .queue(new Command('use_scope',{scope_name:'myscope'}))
      .queue(new Command('import_scene',
        {
          scene_name:'myscene',
          block:true,
          filename: 'scenes/meyemII.mi'
        }),true)
      .execute();
    if (scene_info instanceof Rs_error ) {
      console.log(`Scene load error: ${scene_info.toString()}`);
      return;
    } else {
      scene_loaded(scene_info);
    }
  } catch(err) {
    // In general usage command promises shouldn't reject unless something
    // went fundanmentally wrong. 
    console.error(`System error: ${err.toString()}`);
    service.close();
    return; 
  }
})();
```

## Streaming images from a render loop
A typical interactive browser application will want to start a render loop and display the rendered
images. The WebSocket connection can be tightly bound with a render loop and stream the rendered
results directly to the browser.

```html
<img id="rendered_image"/>
```

```javascript
const user_scope_name = `scope_${RS.Utils.create_random_string(8)}`;
const render_loop_name = `render_loop_${RS.Utils.create_random_string(8)}`;

function scene_loaded(scene_info) {
  const img = document.getElementById('rendered_image');

  service.queue_commands()
    // create a scope for the user
    .queue(new RS.Command('create_scope', { scope_name: user_scope_name, parent_scope: 'myscope' }))
    .queue(new RS.Command('use_scope', { scope_name: user_scope_name }))
    // localize the camera to the user scope
    .queue(new RS.Command('localize_element',{ element_name: scene_info.camera }))
    // set the camera resolution to match the size of the Image element we will display in
    .queue(new RS.Command('camera_set_resolution',
      {
        camera_name: scene_info.camera,
        resolution: { x: img.width, y: img.height }
      }))
    .queue(new RS.Command('camera_set_aspect',
      {
        camera_name: scene_info.camera,
        aspect: img.width / img.height
      }))
    // start the render loop
    .queue(new RS.Command('render_loop_start',
      {
        scene_name: 'myscene',
        render_loop_name: render_loop_name,
        render_loop_handler_name: 'default',
        timeout: 30
      }),true) // want a response for this command
    .execute()
    .then(([ start_response ]) => {
      if (start_response instanceof RS.Error) {
        console.log(`Render loop start error: ${start_response.toString()}`);
        return;
      }
      console.log('Starting render loop stream');

      // Render loop has started, start streaming images to img.
      const stream = service.create_stream();

      // The stream will emit 'image' events whenever a rendered image is received.
      // RS.Utils.html_image_display creates an event handling function which
      // will display rendered images in the provided Image.
      stream.on('image',RS.Utils.html_image_display(img));

      // Also log that we received an image 
      stream.on('image',(image) => {
        if (image.result < 0) {
          return; // error on render
        }
        console.log('Rendered image received');
      });

      // start the stream
      return stream.start(
        {
          render_loop_name,
          image_format: 'jpg',
          quality: '100'
        }
      );
    })
    .then(() => {
      console.log('Render loop stream started');
    })
    .catch(err => {
      // service promises only reject for system errors which are not expected
      // once the web socket is connected
      console.error(`Unexpected service error: ${err.toString()}`);
    });
}

```
## Batch rendering an image

A Node.js connection to RealityServer can be used for batch rendering sets of images. A typical use
case would be to load a scene as above, apply changes then render images to disk as below

```javascript
function render_scene(scene_info, width, height, max_samples, filename) {
  return new Promise(async (resolve,reject) => {
    const camera = scene_info.camera;
    const options = scene_info.options;

    let image;
    try {
      [ image ] = await service.queue_commands()
        .queue(new Command('use_scope', { scope_name: 'myscope' }))
        .queue(new Command('camera_set_resolution',{
          camera_name: camera,
          resolution: {
            x: width,
            y: height
          }
        }))
        .queue(new Command('camera_set_aspect',{
          camera_name: camera,
          aspect: width / height
        }))
        .queue(new Command('element_set_attribute', {
          element_name: options,
          attribute_name: 'progressive_rendering_max_samples',
          attribute_value: max_samples,
          attribute_type: 'Sint32'
        }))
        .queue(new Command('render',
          {
            scene_name: 'myscene',
            renderer: 'iray',
            format: path.extname(filename).slice(1),
            render_context_options: {
              scheduler_mode: {
                value: 'batch',
                type: 'String'
              }
            }
          }),true)
        .execute();

      if (image instanceof Rs_error) {
        reject(`render error: ${image.toString()}`);
      }
    } catch (err) {
      reject(`Service error rendering scene: ${err.toString()}`);
      return;
    }

    if (!image.data) {
      reject('no rendered image');
      return;
    }
    fs.writeFile(filename,image.data,(err) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(`error writing file ${err}`);
      } else {
        resolve(`image saved to ${filename}`);
      }
    });
  });
}
```

## Release Notes

### 2.0.1

Adds support for progress events coming from RealityServer. Currently the only progress messages
supported come from the `import_scene` and `import_scene_elements` commands which will report on
import progress. These commands support a new `import_id` argument to enable identification of which
events are associated with which commands calls. Note that to receive these messages in a timely
manner the commands should either be executed on a stream or with the `longrunning` option set.

Adds support for 'command and control' streams that do not stream images from the associated render
loop. These can be used when scene editing occurs from a different location than render display.
Enable this mode by specifying `NONE` as the `image_format` when starting a stream.

Both of these feature require at least RealityServer 6.3 3384.241.

### 2.0.0

Updated to support streaming multiple rendered images simultaneously. This feature requires at
least RealityServer 6.3 3384.234 and using a custom render loop handler that will return
multiple images. None of the render loop handlers supplied with RealityServer support returning
multiple images.

This change necessitated a major version bump as the payload of the `image` event has an
incompatible structure. Users that solely use `RS.Utils.html_image_display` to manage image events
do not require any changes.

Stream picking now supports the `max_levels` property to control how many objects deep to pick.

### 1.0.10

Added support for a `longrunning` hint to all commands executed on `RS.Service`. For a given Web
Socket connection RealityServer can only process one message at a time. Therefore if a command (or
queue of commands) takes a long time to execute it will not be possible to perform other operations
in parallel. These will queue up and be executed after the long running operation completes. Setting
the `longrunning` option to `true` when creating a command queue or executing commands will cause
these commands to be executed asynchronously on the server, freeing up the connection to process
other messages in parallel. Note this only affects commands executed on `RS.Service`. Those executed
on `RS.Stream` already occur asynchronously. See the 'Concepts' section of the documentation for
more details. This feature requires RealityServer 6.2 3938.141 or later.

Added `RS.Service.connected_protocol_version` to expose the negotiated protocol version.

Added `RS.Command_queue.length` to return the number of commands currently on the queue.

`RS.Matrix4x4.invert` will now throw if the determinant is NaN.

### 1.0.9

Added experimental support for streaming H.264 video to Chrome based browsers via `RS.Utils.html_video_display`.

Added `RS.Stream.pick` to allow picking on the stream.

### 1.0.8

Fixed a reference to an `undefined` variable error if `RS.Service.close` was called when no web
socket connection existed.

Command parameters are now copied internally and those whose value is `undefined` are removed. This
is to ensure that the same parameter set is used in both binary and ascii modes.

Fix scene filename case issue in documentation and other minor documentation issues.

### 1.0.7

Use `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` for Utf8 conversion when in binary mode (IE: when
`Service.debug_commands === false`). If they are not available falls back to the internal Utf8
converters. All modern browsers and Node.js >= 11 support `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder`.

Improved performance of internal Utf8 encoding by several orders of magnitude.

### 1.0.6

`RS.Stream.update_camera` now supports `wait_for_render` in the same was as command
execution does.

`RS.Service.MAX_SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL` now returns the maximum protocol version supported
by this client implementation.

### 1.0.5

Added check that associate scope is supported before trying to use it.

### 1.0.3

Ensure that any protocol commands that are expecting responses are called with an error
if the WebSocket connection closes. This ensures that any pending command execution
promises get fulfilled.

Dependency updates.

### 1.0.2

Fix forward compatibility bug when negotiating protocol version with RealityServer.

### 1.0.1

Documentation and demo link fixes.

Dependency updates.

### 1.0.0

Initial Release.
