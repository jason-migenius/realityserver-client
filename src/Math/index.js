/**
 * Contains general 3D Math functionality. This provides a number of classes
 * for manipulating vectors, matrices and colors plus some general functions on
 * `RS.Math`.
 *
 * Note that all classes and functions on `RS.Math` are also available directly
 * on `RS`. This is to make acessing the classes easier when exposed as ES6 modules.
 * @example
 * import { Vector4, radians } from '@migenius/realityserver-client';
 * // as opposed to
 * import { Math as RSMath } from '@migenius/realityserver-client';
 * const { Vector4, radians } = RSMath;
 * @namespace Math
 * @memberof RS
