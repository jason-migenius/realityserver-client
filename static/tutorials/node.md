The RealityServer Client API provides a unified API in both the browser and Node.js. Consequently most concepts apply in both environments so completing the {@tutorial browser} tutorial is recommended before beginning this one.

This tutorial will take you step by step through the process of creating a simple Node.js based application which performs a single shot scene render of an arbitrary scene on an arbitary RealityServer&reg; instance.

The final application is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/migenius/realityserver-client-node-tutorial](https://github.com/migenius/realityserver-client-node-tutorial)
